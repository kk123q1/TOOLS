/*
 *	Sweet Pea makes callbacks into the host through the host procs. The host
 *	procs are filled in by the host and passed to Sweet Pea at SPInit().
 *
 *	hostData - data that is given back to each host proc when Sweet Pea
 *		calls it. Sweet Pea does nothing with it itself.
 *
 *	extAllocate - implementation of the Block Suite's AllocateBlock() routine.
 *		It is identical to ANSI C malloc(). It returns a pointer to the
 *		beginning of the allocated block or NULL.
 *
 *	extFree - implementation of the Block Suite's FreeBlock() routine. It is
 *		identical to ANSI C free(). Note that you can pass it NULL.
 *
 *	extReallocate - implementation of the Block Suite's ReallocateBlock()
 *		routine. It is identical to ANSI C realloc(). It returns a pointer
 *		to the resized block or NULL. Note that you can pass it NULL or a
 *		newSize of 0.
 *
 *	intAllocate, intFree, intReallocate - routines used by Sweet Pea for
 *		its own memory needs. You may want to allocate blocks differently
 *		with plug-ins and Sweet Pea. Plug-ins are unbounded in their memory
 *		needs, while Sweet Pea's memory usage can be approximated.
 *
 *	startupNotify - called as each plug-in is started up. This is intended
 *		as a way to tell the user what's happening during start up.
 *		Note that plug-ins may start up at any time, not just during
 *		SPStartupPlugins().
 *
 *	shutdownNotify - called as each plug-in is shut down. Also intended as
 *		a way to let users know what's going on.
 *
 *	assertTrap - called when a fatal assert is triggered. Sweet Pea does
 *		not expect execution to continue after an assert.
 *
 *	throwTrap - called when an internal error is thrown. This can be used
 *		during debugging to catch errors as they happen. It should return
 *		to allow Sweet Pea to handle the error.
 *
 *
 *	To aid in getting Sweet Pea up and running quickly, you can set any of
 *	these to NULL and Sweet Pea will use a default implementation. However:
 *	you cannot mix your implementations of the memory routines with
 *	Sweet Pea's defaults.
 *
 *
 *	The string pool functions replace the default routines used internally 
 *	and exported by the Strings suite.  Because they are exported, the behaviors
 *	listed below should be followed.
 *	
 *	allocateStringPool - creates a new string pool instance. The host app and
 *		Sweet Pea have a string pool which can be used by a plug-in, or a plug-in
 *		can create its own.  See the notes in SPStrngs.h on how the pool is 
 *		implemented.  
 *		The function should return kSPNoError if the pool is allocated successfully 
 *		or kSPOutOfMemoryError if allocation fails.
 *		
 *	freeStringPool - disposes of the string pool and any associated memory.  The
 *		funtion should return kSPNoError
 *	
 *	makeWString - the string pool keeps a list of added strings. When a new string is 
 *		added with MakeWString(), the routine checks to see if it is already in the
 *		pool.  If so, the address of the string instance in the pool is returned.  If
 *		not, it will add it to the pool and return the address of the newly
 *		created string instance.  The behavior is:
 *		
 *			if ( string == NULL )
 *					*wString = NULL;
 *					returns kSPNoError;
 *			else if ( string in string pool )
 *					*wString = found string;
 *					returns kSPNoError;
 *			else add string 
 *				if successful
 *					*wString = new string;
 *					returns kSPNoError;
 *				else
 *					*wString = nil
 *					returns kSPOutOfMemoryError
 *			
 *	appStringPool - if the host application has already allocated a string pool to use, 
 *		it's reference should be passed here.  If this value is NULL, Sweet Pea will
 *		allocate the pool when initialized and dispose of it at termination.
 *	
 *	filterEvent - a function called for each event allowing the host to cancel it.  
 *		The event type is indicative of what the filter is to do.  A  file validation 
 *		is called before a directory entry is added to the file list (kAddFile).
 *		A plug-in validation before a file is checked for PiPL information (kAddPlugin);
 *		the host might examine the file name/type to determine whether it should be added.
 *		For these 'add' events the return value is TRUE if the item should be skipped 
 *		or FALSE if should be should be added. The default filter proc, used (if NULL) 
 *		is passed, will skip files/folders in ( ).
 *		The other event is kSuitesAvailable.  It is called when the last suite adding 
 *		plug-in	(as determined by available PiPL information) has been added.  This is 
 *		a point at which the host can cancel the startup process; for instance, if the host
 *		requires a suite from a plug-in, this is the time to check for it.  If the 
 *		host returns TRUE, the startup process continues.  If it returns FALSE, the
 *		plug-in startup is canceled and the host would likely terminate or startup in
 *		an alternate manner.
 *
 *	overrideAddPlugins - if supplied, SP will call the host to create the runtime
 *		plug-in list.  This occurs at SPStartupPlugins().  The function takes no parameters 
 *		as it is up to the host to determine how to do this.  For instance, the host can do 
 *		this from cached data or, as SP would, from the file list.  A returned error will 
 *		stop the plug-in startup process.
 *
 *	overrideStartup - a function called for each SP2 plug-in before it is sent the
 *		startup message.  If the host returns FALSE, SP will startup the plug-in normal.
 *		If the host returns true, it is assumed that the host has handled the startup
 *		for the plug-in, so SP will not do anything for the plug-in.  This is intended
 *		to be used with a plug-in caching scheme.  
 *		The host would be responsible, for instance, for defining the cacheable
 * 		information in the PiPL, adding it when the callback is made, and later issuing
 *		a startup message when the plug-in is actually needed (e.g. when a menu item 
 *		is selected.)  Two notes: don't forget to SetPluginStarted(), and make sure
 *		to use a string pooled char* to kSPInterfaceCaller and kSPInterfaceStartupSelector.
 *
 *	resolveLink - Windows only.  If the search for plug-ins is to recurse sub-folders,
 *		the host needs to suply this routine.  When a .lnk file is encountered, the
 *		resolveLink host callback function will be called and should return a resolved path.
 *		This is a host callback due to OLE issues such as initialization, which the SP
 *		libary does not currently handle.  If it returns an error code, the result will
 *		be ignored.
 *
 *	getPluginAccess - Allows the host to set the plug-in access information.  This would
 *		be used if, for instance, the host kept its own plug-in list (ala, Photoshop), but
 *		still needed these to be compatible with SPPlugins (e.g. whose accesses are used by ADM)
 *
 *	memoryIsCritical - Mac only.  Allows the host to indicate that memory is in a critical state 
 *		(really low, but can't be purged because you are, say, shutdown.)
 * 		If so and the plug-in load target heap is the app heap, when a plug-in fails to load
 *		SP will then try to load the plug-in into the system heap
