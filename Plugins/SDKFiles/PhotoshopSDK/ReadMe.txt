Welcome to the Adobe Photoshop CS
Software Development Kit
Macintosh and Windows
Version CS ( 8.0 ) (10/20/2003)

_______________________________________________________________________________
What’s new in CS?

Photoshop now runs on OS X only. This means all of your plug ins must be 
Carbonized. See the section below Quick Start to Carbonizing Plug Ins. 
Photoshop will not load Non-Carbon plug ins.

All shipping plug-ins are using the packaging method. You see one file that 
looks like a plug-in but it is actually a package with the Carbon plug ins. 
See the section below Packaging Plug Ins.

Windows XP changes. Your plug in must tell the OS that it is XP aware.
 1. Download the latest Microsoft Windows Platform SDK from 
    <http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate>
 2. Launch MSDEV. From the menus: Tools->Options->Directories.
    Add a path to the new includes as the first search path. 
    Example: E:\Program Files\Microsoft SDK\Include
 3. In your plug in project settings add ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED 
    C/C++ Tab -> Category = General -> Preprocessor definitions
 4. Rebuild your plug in.
 NOTE: This is not required for ADM, Adobe Dialog Manager, based plug ins.

The Scripting Support plug in developed for Illustrator is now available for 
Photoshop. This plug-in comes installed by default. You can now create 
JavaScript, AppleScript, and Visual Basic scripts.

Photoshop File Formats document is updated to reflect new options in version CS.

New properties available, see PIProperties.h and the Propetizer example: 
propDontShowAgainCount.

New PiPL properties:
	File Format modules can add XMPRead and XMPWrite properties to allow the 
	file browser quick access to the XMP data inside your file.
	
	File Format modules can add FileProperties and LosslessRotate to allow the
	file browser quickly rotate these files without opening the document.
	
	Automation plug-ins can add FileBrowserAware to add a menu item in the file
	browser dialog.
	
	Plug-ins can specify the maximum and minimum document sizes they work with.
	PlugInMaxSize and PlugInMinSize.
	
	Plug-ins can specify NoAboutBox. This will cause Photoshop to not add an 
	entry in the About menu.

Quick Start to Carbonizing Plug Ins

Get the Carbon SDK from the Apple web site. http://www.apple.com. You don’t 
need to install the header files if you are using Metrowerks Pro 8.0.

Create new projects, cloning your existing projects, for Carbon Debug and 
Carbon Release

In your settings for the Carbon versions include PIRezMacCarbon.h as the 
Prefix file for Rez files. Include PIDebugCarbon.h or PICarbon.h for the 
Prefix file for your C/C++ files.

Add the following to your PiPL resource replacing the CodePowerPC{...}. 
If you are using CodeFragmentPPC the new selector would be CodeFragmentCarbonPPC.

CodeCarbonPowerPC { 0, 0, "" },

Remove the Non-Carbonized libraries from your Carbon projects. Include CarbonLib
and any other Carbonized libraries you may need. Compile and Link your projects.

NOTE: 
Photoshop CS will not load Non-Carbonized plug ins.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Packaging Plug Ins

Plug ins that ship with Photoshop CS are now inside packages. Below is the 
directory layout for the Dissolve Release plug in. The CodeWarrior project 
settings are given below.

Dissolve:Contents:MacOSClassic::Dissolve.8bf
Dissolve:Contents:PkgInfo
Dissolve:Dissolve.8bf

The first item is the actual plug ins. The second item is the package info 
created by Metrowerks and the third item is an alias to the classic version of 
the plug in. All of this was done by simply enabling the Mac OS Packager in the 
Metrowerks projects.

Carbon Release project for Dissolve. Mac OS Packager Panel
Turn on Use Mac OS Packager and select the Release:Dissolve: folder to package.
Turn off Create alias to Classic executable.
Turn on Create PkgInfo file and use the same creator/type settings for your plug 
in.

Build both projects and ensure that the folder layout is the same as above.

Debugging Plug Ins on OS X via Terminal

Detailed information for debugging a Photoshop session is available by launching 
the applicatoin via the Terminal program. Use the following commands in your 
Terminal window to launch Photoshop. I am using abosulte paths, you may need to 
modify.

setenv CFMDebug 1
setenv CFMDebugFull 1
cd '/Volumes/Photoshop/Adobe Photoshop CS/Adobe Photoshop CS/Contents/MacOS/'
/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Support/LaunchCFMApp 'Adobe Photoshop CS'

_______________________________________________________________________________
Metrowerks debugging

Open the Runtime Settings panel in the project. 
Set the Host application to be Photoshop. 

NOTE: CW has a bug where [sometimes] you'll have to close and re-open your 
project after changing the host)

Make a shortcut in the Photoshop plug-in's folder to your plug-in.
Set some break points and choose debug from CodeWarrior

_______________________________________________________________________________
To install

Double-click the installer file.
Documentation requires Acrobat
The documentation included on this kit requires, at minimum, Acrobat Reader to 
view it. To download a copy of Acrobat Reader free of charge, go to 
http://www.adobe.com/.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Metrowerks CodeWarrior

All the Macintosh projects in this SDK were tested in the latest CodeWarrior 
environment, CW Pro 8.0, Release Edition, IDE 5.1.1. 

_______________________________________________________________________________
Microsoft Visual Studio

All the Windows projects in this SDK were tested in the latest Visual Studio 
environment, .NET 2003 v7.1. The custom build step for the .r file usually gets
extra quotation's during the conversion from MSDEV 6.0 projects. Use the 
project properties to fix this conversion error.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Memory

Always ask Photoshop for your memory when you dynamically allocate storage space. 
This can be accomplished by including the PIUNew.cpp file in your project work 
space. This file over rides operator new and delete to call Photoshop memory 
routines. The only dependency is that the SSPBasic* is defined globally as 
sSPBasic.

NOTE: 
If you are running on Photoshop version 4.0 or earlier this is not a valid solution.

_______________________________________________________________________________
C++ exceptions

If you turn on C++ exceptions in your plug in project make sure you wrap all 
of your call backs with try/catch blocks. You do not want to throw back into 
Photoshop. This will cause Photoshop to disappear without a warning to the user. 
Make sure your try/catch blocks are around your PluginMain routine and any OS 
proc, say for your Dialog routine.
